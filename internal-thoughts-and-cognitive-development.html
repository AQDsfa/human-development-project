        <h2>Infancy and Childhood</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Sensory Motor Stage:</strong> Lasts from birth to nearly age 2. Babies take in the world through senses and actions.
            Object permanence, the awareness that things exist even when not perceived, develops during this stage.
            Around 8 months old, infants begin exhibiting memory for things no longer seen. Researchers believe that object permanence develops gradually over time.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Preoperational Stage:</strong> Lasts from roughly age 2 until ages 6 or 7. Children represent things with words and images but are too young to perform mental operations like imagining something and mentally reversing it.
            Before about age 6, children lack the concept of conservation; the principle that quantity remains the same despite changes in shape (think liquids).
            Children develop symbolic thinking and pretend play during this stage. Children during this stage are egocentric: they have difficulty perceiving things from another’s point of view.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Concrete Operational Stage:</strong> Children usually enter this stage by about age 7 according to Piaget.
            Given concrete (physical) materials, they can begin to grasp operational concepts such as conservation.
            Children become able to comprehend mathematical transformations and conservation. Example: Reversing a simple equation. 8 + 4 = 12, so what is 12 - 4 =?
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Formal Operational Stage:</strong> By age 12, reasoning expands from the concrete to the abstract.
            As children approach adolescence, they begin to ponder hypothetical propositions and deduce consequences: If this, then that.
            Full-blown logic and reasoning don’t develop until adolescence.

            Aging and Memory: Whatever people experience around their teens and twenties becomes pivotal in their lives.
            Your teens and twenties hold so many memorable firsts that they seem to make lasting memories.
            Older adults seem to have more issues with memory recall than memory recognition.
        </p>

        <p>
            Maintaining Mental Abilities: Our brain’s natural plasticity gives us the ability to improve its function throughout life.
            Video Game playing may enhance peoples attention - computer game makers have been marketing daily brain-exercise programs for older adults.
            The verdict is out on whether these types of programs actually improve or enhance our cognitive abilities.
            They improve your performance on those trained tasks; however, there is little evidence to show that they improve performance on closely related tasks or distantly related tasks and overall cognitive functioning.
        </p>

        <p>
            Neurocognitive Disorders and Alzheimer’s Disease: NCD also referred to as dementia can be caused by small strokes, brain tumors, or alcohol use disorder that progressively damages the brain.
            Alzheimer’s disease strikes 3% of the world's population by age 75.
            Up to age 95, the incidence of mental disintegration doubles roughly every 5 years.
