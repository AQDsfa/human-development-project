        <h2>Infancy and Childhood</h2>
        <p>
            Piaget’s Theory of Cognitive Development focuses on interactions with the physical world. 
            In the Sensory Motor Stage (birth to nearly age 2), babies take in the world through senses and actions.
            Object permanence, the awareness that things exist even when not perceived, develops during this stage.
            Around 8 months old, infants begin exhibiting memory for things no longer seen.
            Researchers believe that object permanence develops gradually over time.

        <h2>Adolescence</h2>
        <p>
            Developing Reasoning Power: Formal operational thinking allows adolescents to apply abstract reasoning tools to the world around them.
            They debate human nature, good and evil, truth, and justice.
            Sense of what is fair changes from simple equality to equity - to what’s proportional to merit.
            Allows for hypothetical reasoning and deducing consequences, enabling them to detect inconsistencies and hypocrisy in others’ reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Developing Morality: Crucial tasks of childhood and adolescence are determining right from wrong.
            Moral reasoning builds on cognitive development.
            Kohlberg proposed three basic levels of moral thinking: preconventional, conventional, and post-conventional.
            Moral Intuition: Psychologist Jonathan Haidt believes that much of our morality is rooted in moral intuitions “Quick Gut Feelings”.
            According to this view, the mind makes moral judgments in much the same way it makes aesthetic judgments - quickly and automatically.

    <section id="adulthood">
        <h2>Adulthood</h2>
        <p>
            Aging and Memory: Whatever people experience around their teens and twenties becomes pivotal in their lives.
            Your teens and twenties hold so many memorable firsts that they seem to make lasting memories.
            Older adults seem to have more issues with memory recall than memory recognition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maintaining Mental Abilities: Our brain’s natural plasticity gives us the ability to improve its function throughout life.
            Video Game playing may enhance peoples attention - computer game makers have been marketing daily brain-exercise programs for older adults.
            The verdict is out on whether these types of programs actually improve or enhance our cognitive abilities.
            They improve your performance on those trained tasks, however, there is little evidence to show that they improve performance on closely related tasks or distantly related tasks and overall cognitive functioning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neurocognitive Disorders and Alzheimer’s Disease: NCD also referred to as dementia can be caused by small strokes, brain tumors, or alcohol use disorder that progressively damages the brain.
            Alzheimer’s disease strikes 3% of the world's population by age 75.
            Up to age 95, the incidence of mental disintegration doubles roughly every 5 years.
