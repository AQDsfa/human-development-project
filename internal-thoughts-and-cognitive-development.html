        <h2>Infancy and Childhood</h2>
        <p>
            Explore the complex terrain of cognitive development, beginning with the basic **Sensory Motor Stage**,
            which lasts from birth to about two years of age. Using their senses and their motor skills, newborns absorb
            knowledge about the world throughout this stage. One important development is the concept of object permanence,
            which is the knowledge that things exist outside of our immediate senses. A developmental milestone that is thought
            to occur gradually is the notable display of memory recall for objects that are no longer in the infant's direct
            field of vision around the age of 8 months.

            As they enter the **Preoperational Stage**, which lasts about from age 2 to 6 or 7, children start to use language and 
            imagery to symbolically depict concepts. But the ability to perform mental functions like visualizing and mentally
            undoing actions is still developing. Before six years old, there is a conceptual gap in the knowledge of conservation;
            in this case, the number of substances is thought to stay the same even when their shape changes. This stage is typified
            by developing symbolic cognition and creative play that are entangled with a level of egocentrism that makes it difficult to take
            into account different viewpoints.
            
            Moving through the cognitive phases, children reach the **Concrete Operational Stage** approximately about 7 years old, at which
            point they are able to understand operational ideas such as conservation by skillfully interacting with physical items. It is possible
            to do mathematical transformations, such as reversing equations. At age 12, the trip reaches its apex with the **Formal Operational Stage**,
            which is characterized by the shift from concrete to abstract reasoning. Teenagers begin to consider theoretical situations and begin to
            move into the domain of complete logic and reasoning. This cognitive development continues into adolescence.

            Aging and Memory: Whatever people experience around their teens and twenties becomes pivotal in their lives.
            Your teens and twenties hold so many memorable firsts that they seem to make lasting memories.
            Older adults seem to have more issues with memory recall than memory recognition.

            Maintaining Mental Abilities: Our brain’s natural plasticity gives us the ability to improve its function throughout life.
            Video Game playing may enhance peoples attention - computer game makers have been marketing daily brain-exercise programs for older adults.
            The verdict is out on whether these types of programs actually improve or enhance our cognitive abilities.
            They improve your performance on those trained tasks; however, there is little evidence to show that they improve performance on closely related tasks or distantly related tasks and overall cognitive functioning.

            Neurocognitive Disorders and Alzheimer’s Disease: NCD also referred to as dementia can be caused by small strokes, brain tumors, or alcohol use disorder that progressively damages the brain.
            Alzheimer’s disease strikes 3% of the world's population by age 75.
            Up to age 95, the incidence of mental disintegration doubles roughly every 5 years.
